EHR Code Mapping Module (medcode): module, core medcode component, facilitates mapping within various medical coding systems (e.g., ICD, NDC, RxNorm). Key functionalities like code lookup, hierarchy navigation, cross-system mapping, ATC utilities already implemented, demonstrated examples . Looking ahead, development roadmap includes expansion RHealth several key modules enhancements: Healthcare DL Core Module: module integrate traditional machine learning models (e.g., Random Forests, Support Vector Machines) state---art healthcare-specific deep learning models (e.g., RETAIN, AdaCare, Transformers, graph networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks). Prediction Task Module: module designed handle various clinical prediction tasks using EHR data, including patient-level predictions (e.g., mortality, disease risk), intra-visit predictions (e.g., length stay, drug recommendation), inter-visit predictions (e.g., readmission risk, future diagnoses). Support Multi-modal Data Integration: Enhancements handle integrate diverse data types beyond structured EHR data. Clinical Trial Applications: Developing functionalities support research analysis context clinical trials. Large Language Model (LLM) Enhancement: Exploring integration LLMs augment package capabilities.

\usage{
CNN(dataset = NULL, embedding_dim = 128, hidden_dim = 128, num_layers = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A \code{SampleDataset} object providing input/output schema}

\item{embedding_dim}{Integer, embedding dimension. Default 128}

\item{hidden_dim}{Integer, number of CNN channels. Default 128}

\item{num_layers}{Integer, number of CNN blocks. Default 1}
}
\description{
Convolutional neural network model for healthcare prediction tasks.
Each feature is embedded and processed through independent CNN layers.
The pooled representations are concatenated for final prediction.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Supports binary, multi-class, and regression tasks
\item Each feature has its own CNN encoder
\item Handles sequence, timeseries, and tensor inputs
\item Automatically determines spatial dimensions based on processor type
}

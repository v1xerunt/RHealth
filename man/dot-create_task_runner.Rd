\title{Helper function to create a clean closure for parallel processing}
\usage{
.create_task_runner(task)
}
\arguments{
\item{task}{The task object to be used inside the closure.}
}
\value{
A function that takes a patient dataframe (\code{pdf}) and applies the task.
}
\description{
This function acts as a factory. It creates and returns another function
(a closure) that is suitable for use with \code{future.apply}. The returned
function's environment is intentionally minimal, containing only the \code{task}
object. This prevents large objects from the parent environment (like the
full event dataframe) from being accidentally exported to parallel workers.

# RHealth

[![docs](https://github.com/v1xerunt/RHealth/actions/workflows/docs/badge.svg)](https://github.com/v1xerunt/RHealth/actions/workflows/docs)

**RHealth** is an open-source R package designed to bring a comprehensive deep learning toolkit to the R community for healthcare predictive modeling. It provides an accessible, integrated environment for R users to build, train, and evaluate complex models on EHR data. This package is the R counterpart to the popular Python library [PyHealth](https://github.com/sunlabuiuc/PyHealth).

RHealth is funded by the [ISC grant from the R Consortium](https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/2024-group-2.html#deeprhealth-a-deep-learning-toolkit-for-healthcare-predictive-modeling).

## üß± Modules

RHealth is organized into several powerful, interconnected modules.

### ‚öïÔ∏è 1. Medical Code Module

This standalone module helps map medical codes between different systems.

**Code Lookup:**

```r
lookup_code(code = "428.0", system = "ICD9CM")
```

**Find Ancestors/Descendants:**

```r
# Get all parent codes
get_ancestors(code = "428.22", system = "ICD9CM")

# Get all child codes
get_descendants(code = "428", system = "ICD9CM")
```

**Cross-System Mapping:**

```r
# Map from ICD-9 to CCS
map_code(code = "428.0", from = "ICD9CM", to = "CCSCM")
```

### üõ¢Ô∏è 2. Dataset Module

The **Dataset** module is the foundation of RHealth. It transforms raw, multi-table Electronic Health Record (EHR) dumps into tidy, task-ready tensors that any downstream model can consume.

**Key Features:**

  * **Efficient Ingestion**: Streams large CSVs using Polars `LazyFrame` to avoid loading massive files into RAM.
  * **Data Harmonisation**: Merges heterogeneous tables into a single, canonical event table.
  * **Built-in Caching**: Uses DuckDB for CSV ‚Üí Parquet caching, enabling up to 10x faster reloads.
  * **Dev Mode**: Allows for lightning-fast iteration by using a small subset of patients.

**Quick Start:**

Define a dataset from your source files using a YAML configuration.

```r
# The YAML config defines tables, patient IDs, timestamps, and attributes
# See the full documentation for details on the YAML structure.

# Load the dataset
ds <- BaseDataset$new(
  root         = "path/to/mimic4",
  tables       = c("patients", "admissions", "labevents"),
  dataset_name = "mimic4_ehr",
  dev          = TRUE  # limit to 1,000 patients for speed
)

ds$stats()
#> Dataset : mimic4_ehr
#> Dev mode : TRUE
#> Patients : 1 000
#> Events   : 2 187 540
```

### üéØ 3. Task Module

The **Task** module defines the prediction problem. It tells RHealth *what* to predict, *which* data to use, and *how* to generate `(input, target)` samples from a patient's event timeline.

A task is defined by subclassing `BaseTask` and implementing the `call()` method.

**Example Task Definition:**

```r
MyReadmissionTask <- R6::R6Class(
  "MyReadmissionTask",
  inherit = BaseTask,
  public = list(
    initialize = function() {
      super$initialize(
        task_name     = "MyReadmissionTask",
        input_schema  = list(diagnoses = "sequence", procedures = "sequence"),
        output_schema = list(outcome = "binary")
      )
    },
    call = function(patient) {
      # Your logic to generate samples for a single patient...
      # This should return a list or list-of-lists with named fields
      # matching the input/output schemas.
      
      # Example:
      # list(
      #   diagnoses = c("401.9", "250.00"),
      #   procedures = c("88.72"),
      #   outcome = 1
      # )
    }
  )
)
```

**Generating Samples:**

Once a task is defined, use it with your dataset to create a `SampleDataset` compatible with `{torch}`.

```r
task    <- Readmission30DaysMIMIC4$new() # A built-in task
samples <- ds$set_task(task)
loader  <- dataloader(samples, batch_size = 64, shuffle = TRUE)
```

### üß† 4. Model Module

The **Model** module provides ready-to-use neural network architectures. All models inherit from a `BaseModel`, which automates dimension calculation, loss function selection, and device management (CPU/GPU).

**Built-in Models:**

RHealth includes reference implementations like `RNN`, which can be instantiated in one line:

```r
model <- RNN(
  dataset       = samples, # The SampleDataset from set_task()
  embedding_dim = 128,
  hidden_dim    = 128
)
```

**Custom Models:**

You can easily write your own model by inheriting from `BaseModel`.

```r
MyDenseNet <- torch::nn_module(
  "MyDenseNet",
  inherit = BaseModel,
  initialize = function(dataset, hidden_dim = 256) {
    super$initialize(dataset) # IMPORTANT: handles schema setup
    
    # Calculate input/output dimensions automatically
    in_dim  <- sum(purrr::map_int(dataset$input_processors, "size"))
    out_dim <- self$get_output_size()

    self$fc1 <- nn_linear(in_dim, hidden_dim)
    self$fc2 <- nn_linear(hidden_dim, out_dim)
  },
  forward = function(inputs) {
    # Flatten and concatenate all input features
    x <- torch::torch_cat(purrr::flatten(inputs), dim = 2)
    logits <- self$fc2(torch_relu(self$fc1(x)))

    # Return loss and probabilities
    list(
      loss   = self$get_loss_function()(logits, inputs[[self$label_keys]]),
      y_prob = self$prepare_y_prob(logits)
    )
  }
)
```

### üí™ 5. Trainer Module

The **Trainer** module provides a high-level, configurable training loop that handles logging, checkpointing, evaluation, and progress bars.

**Example Training Workflow:**

```r
# 1. Create data loaders
train_loader <- dataloader(train_samples, batch_size = 32, shuffle = TRUE)
val_loader   <- dataloader(val_samples,   batch_size = 64)

# 2. Instantiate a model
model <- RNN(train_samples, embedding_dim = 128, hidden_dim = 128)

# 3. Set up the trainer
trainer <- Trainer$new(
    model,
    metrics     = c("auroc", "auprc"),
    output_path = "experiments",
    exp_name    = "mortality_rnn"
)

# 4. Start training
trainer$train(
    train_dataloader  = train_loader,
    val_dataloader    = val_loader,
    epochs            = 10,
    learning_rate     = 1e-3,
    weight_decay      = 1e-4,
    max_grad_norm     = 5.0,
    monitor           = "auroc" # Save the best model based on AUROC
)
```

Logs and model checkpoints (`best.ckpt`, `last.ckpt`) are saved automatically to `experiments/mortality_rnn/`.

## üöÄ Future Plans

RHealth is under active development. Our roadmap includes:

  * **Healthcare DL Core Module**: Adding more SoTA models like RETAIN, AdaCare, and Transformers.
  * **Prediction Task Module**: Adding built-in tasks for common clinical predictions (e.g., length of stay, readmission risk).
  * **Multi-modal Data**: Enhancing support for integrating imaging, genomics, and clinical notes.
  * **LLM Integration**: Augmenting package capabilities with Large Language Models.

We welcome feedback and contributions\! Please submit an issue on GitHub or contact the maintainers.
